(Ongoing) I explore a class of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) that bottleneck into discrete representations, which are called Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE). I implement the models in TensorFlow 2 and experiment with a few different datasets. I also implement state-of-the-art generative models (such as PixelCNN) to learn priors over the discrete representations, which enables high-quality data generation.
