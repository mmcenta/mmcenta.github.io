In this project, we attempt to solve the popular game 2048 with Deep Reinforcement Learning. Our final solution uses Deep Q-Networks with a few extensions to achieve better scores than we were able to find in other similar projects. We cound that convolutional feature extractors and one-hot encoding inputs is essential to reach the 2048 tile. For more details, you can read [our report](https://github.com/mmcenta/left-shift/blob/master/docs/report.pdf).
