My name is Matheus Centa and I am a student with interest in Machine Learning. In 2021, I will finish my Master's Degree in Statistical and Deep Learning at École Polytechnique/UPMC. My interest lies in understanding intelligence and creating better AI in the process. Currently, I am particularly interested in reinforcement learning, meta-learning and unsupervised learning.

I am currently looking for an internship for the summer of 2021.

If you're interested, check ou:
