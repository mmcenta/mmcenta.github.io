Hello, my name is Matheus and I am studying Machine Learning. In 2021, I will finish my Master's Degree in Statistical and Deep Learning at Ã‰cole Polytechnique/UPMC. My interest lies in understanding intelligence and creating better AI in the process. Currently, I am particularly interested in reinforcement learning, meta-learning and unsupervised learning.

## News

* **I am currently looking for an internship for the summer of 2021**;
* I will be attenting the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop by Simons Intitutite](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/rl-2020-1) via Zoom;
* I am following 2020's [Berkeley's Deep Reinforcement Learning course](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/), [here](https://github.com/mmcenta/berkeley-deeprlcourse)'s the homework repository.
